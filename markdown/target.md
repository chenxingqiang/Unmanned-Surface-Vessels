üìò Project Proposal: Development of Intelligent Navigation and Control System for Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs)

‚∏ª

1. Background and Significance

Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs), as high-autonomy watercraft, have gained increasing attention in recent years due to their broad applications in oceanographic research, environmental monitoring, maritime rescue, and military patrols. With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, sensor fusion, and autonomous control, USVs have demonstrated exceptional potential in replacing manned operations in hazardous or repetitive environments.

Internationally, regions such as Europe, Japan, South Korea, and the United States are heavily investing in USV research and development. The IMO has initiated frameworks for Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS), emphasizing safety and regulatory integration. Domestically, initiatives such as ‚ÄúMade in China 2025‚Äù and the CCS ‚ÄúIntelligent Ship Guidelines‚Äù have positioned smart ships as a key development area.

Despite the progress, challenges remain in ensuring autonomous navigation under complex maritime environments (e.g., narrow channels, high-traffic waters). Developing an intelligent navigation and control system is essential for enhancing USV safety, decision-making, and environmental adaptability.
