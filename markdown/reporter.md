# USV Control System Enhancements Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the improvements made to the Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) control system and the results of comparative tests between different control algorithms.

## Enhancements

### 1. USV Dynamic Model Improvements

The USV dynamic model was enhanced with several stability improvements:

- Added velocity bounds to prevent numerical overflow issues
- Implemented acceleration limits to ensure simulation stability
- Added error handling for numerical issues in matrix operations
- Applied reasonable limits to state variables to keep the simulation within physically realistic bounds

### 2. LQR Controller Improvements

The Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller was enhanced with:

- Added fallback method when the Riccati equation solver fails
- Implemented a pole placement based approach as an alternative control strategy
- Added regularization to ensure numerical stability
- Improved scaling of gains based on Q and R weights

### 3. MPC Controller Improvements

The Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller was enhanced with:

- Added robust error handling for optimization failures
- Implemented a fallback proportional control strategy for when optimization fails
- Added monitoring of optimization success status
- Improved numerical stability in prediction calculations

### 4. Testing Framework

A comprehensive testing framework was developed to compare the controllers:

- Created test scenarios for different operating conditions:
  - Waypoint following (square path)
  - Station keeping with disturbances
  - Path following with varying environmental disturbances
  - High-speed maneuvering
  - Obstacle avoidance
- Implemented automatic plot generation and saving
- Enhanced visualization of controller performance metrics

## Test Results

The testing revealed the following characteristics of each controller:

### PID Controller

The Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller showed:
- Simple implementation and low computational requirements
- Good performance for basic waypoint following
- Required different gain tuning for different scenarios
- Less robust to significant environmental disturbances

### LQR Controller

The Linear Quadratic Regulator controller demonstrated:
- More systematic approach to gain selection
- Better disturbance rejection than PID in most cases
- Occasionally encountered numerical issues with Riccati equation solution
- Fallback method provided acceptable performance when optimal solution was unavailable

### MPC Controller

The Model Predictive Control controller exhibited:
- Superior performance in highly dynamic scenarios
- Best anticipation of future states and constraints
- Higher computational requirements
- Optimization occasionally failed in extreme conditions, but fallback strategy provided reliable control

## Conclusion

Each controller has its strengths and weaknesses:

1. **PID**: Simple, reliable, and suitable for basic operations
2. **LQR**: Good balance between performance and computational requirements
3. **MPC**: Best performance, especially in complex scenarios, but higher computational cost

The enhancements made to all controllers have significantly improved the robustness of the USV control system, ensuring stable operation even in challenging conditions with environmental disturbances.

For future work, more sophisticated disturbance estimation and rejection techniques could further improve performance, particularly for the LQR and MPC controllers.
